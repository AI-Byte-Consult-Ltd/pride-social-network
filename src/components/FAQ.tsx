          answer: "Web3 is the new generation of the internet, based on blockchain technologies. Pride Social Network uses Web3 to create a decentralized social network where users own their data and receive fair rewards for activity."
        },
        {
          question: "What is blockchain and why is it important?",
          answer: "Blockchain is a distributed database that ensures transparency, security and immutability of records. In our network, it guarantees fair token distribution and protection against fraud."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need to know technical details to use the platform?",
          answer: "No! We've created an intuitive interface. You only need to connect your wallet â€” everything else works like a regular social network."

      questions: [
        {
          question: "What is the ERC-20 PRIDE token?",
          answer: "ERC-20 is a standard token format on the Ethereum blockchain. PRIDE is our token that you receive for network activity. It can be stored in any wallet that supports ERC-20."

        {
          question: "Is PRIDE token emission limited?",
          answer: "Yes, the maximum number of PRIDE tokens is limited to 100 million. This creates a deflationary model and potential for value growth."
        },
        {
          question: "On which exchanges is PRIDE traded?",
          answer: "PRIDE is available on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and SushiSwap. We're also working on listings on centralized exchanges."

        },
        {
          question: "What should I do if I lose access to my wallet?",
